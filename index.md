# About Me
<img align="left" src="ProfilePic.jpg" alt="Profile Image" width="200">
I grew up in northwestern North Carolina and attended Appalachian State Univeristy (Go 'Neers!). It was there that I double majored in Physics and Mathematics. During my time as an undergraduate, I served as a research assistant in ASU's Ion Trap Laboratory under the direction of Dr. Tony Calamai. After graduating, I spent a year teaching Mathematics at Ashe County High School (where I received my own high school diploma!) and a semester teaching Physics at Wilkes Community College. I then returned to ASU to complete my M.S. in Engineering Physics and M.A. in Mathematics. Here, I worked as a graduate research assistant under the direction of Dr. Eric Marland. Much of my work was focused on sensitivity analyses using atmospheric modeling. I am now a Ph.D. student in the Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Utah, working with Dr. John Lin where I specialize in land-atmosphere interactions. In my free time I am hiking, playing various musical instruments (piano and violin/fiddle), or occasionally working along the New River back home.
