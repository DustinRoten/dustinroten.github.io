    <h2>Biosketch</h2>
    I am a scientist who specializes in land-atmosphere interactions relating to the carbon cycle. I study the high resolution dynamics of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from cities like Los Angeles (CA) and Salt Lake City (UT), leveraging myriad tools and techniques such as atmospheric models, ground-based measurement networks, and space-based observations. In addition to my work as an atmospheric scientist, I have taught mathematics, statistics, and physics at high school, community college, and university levels. I am now a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. If I'm not knee deep in research, you can catch me hiking, playing piano or violin/fiddle, or relaxing back home in North Carolina.

  <h2>My Research</h2>
  I study how carbon is cycled through the Earth system and the influences that humans have on these flows. I do this through two established research projects that focus on carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions from (1) small rivers and streams in the Appalachian region and (2) megacities around the world. My work has combined <strong>in-situ measurements</strong>, <strong>aircraft</strong>, and <strong>space-based remote sensing platforms</strong> to understand where natural and human-caused CO₂ emissions come from, how fluxes change over time, and how these changes affect Earth’s climate system. These efforts require me to blend advanced mathematics, atmospheric modeling, satellite retrievals, and data collected in the field to provide accurate and actionable information that drives carbon cycle science and informs communities.

  <h2>Space-Based Urban Carbon Observation</h2>
  <p>
    Cities are major contributors to global CO₂ emissions, yet they are among the most challenging places to measure accurately. During my Ph.D. and postdoctoral work with NASA’s Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-2 and OCO-3) missions, I developed tools that use dense satellite measurements to detect sector-specific emissions — such as traffic and energy production — and track how they evolve over time.
  </p>
  <p>
    These methods revealed clear changes in emissions during real events, such as reductions in traffic during the COVID-19 lockdown in Los Angeles.
    This work informs the emerging field of <strong>urban carbon monitoring</strong>, demonstrating how satellites can provide near-real-time insights that support local climate action.
  </p>
  <p>
    I now serve as the <strong>Science Principal Investigator</strong> for <strong>CMS-Urban</strong>, a NASA-funded project that expands this approach to multiple cities worldwide and incorporates additional atmospheric pollutants (CH₄, NO₂).
    This project builds toward operational observing systems capable of providing routine, high-resolution emissions estimates to scientists, policymakers, and the public.

<section id="stream-project">
  <h2>STREAM: Carbon Emissions from Appalachian Headwaters</h2>
  <p>
    Beyond cities, small headwater streams and creeks release CO₂ and CH₄ as carbon moves through the land-to-water continuum.
    These systems are widespread in the Appalachian Mountains but are too small to be measured from orbit, and they represent one of the most uncertain components of the modern carbon budget.
  </p>
  <p>
    To address this gap, I lead the <strong>STREAM project</strong> (Small Tributaries Releasing Emissions in the Appalachian Mountains).
    STREAM brings together scientists, teachers, and students to collect in-situ greenhouse gas measurements from rivers and streams that satellites cannot observe.
    These ground-based observations are combined with NASA satellite data and data assimilation methods to better understand regional carbon emissions and improve carbon-cycle models.
  </p>
  <p>
    STREAM not only fills a major scientific need — it also creates opportunities for students in rural communities to participate directly in climate science, building a bridge between local engagement and cutting-edge research.
