  <p>
    I am an atmospheric scientist who specializes in land-atmosphere interactions. Specifically, my interests lie in anthropogenic aspects of the carbon cycle. I study the high resolution dynamics of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from cities like Los Angeles (CA) and Salt Lake City (UT). I leverage several tools to study these emissions such as atmospheric models, ground-based measurement networks, and space-based observations. Before focusing on urban emissions, I spent time as a high school math teacher, community college physics instructor, and research assistant in a plasma diagnostics laboratory. I am now a Ph.D. candidate in Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Utah. If I'm not researching, you can catch me hiking, playing piano or violin/fiddle, or relaxing back home in North Carolina.
