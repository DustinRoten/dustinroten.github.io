    <h2>Biosketch</h2>
    <p> 
    I am a scientist who specializes in land-atmosphere interactions relating to the carbon cycle. I study the high resolution dynamics of CO₂ emissions from cities like Los Angeles (CA) and Salt Lake City (UT), leveraging myriad tools and techniques such as atmospheric models, ground-based measurement networks, and space-based observations. In addition to my work as an atmospheric scientist, I have taught mathematics, statistics, and physics at high school, community college, and university levels. I am now a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. If I'm not knee deep in research, you can catch me hiking, playing piano or violin/fiddle, or relaxing back home in North Carolina.

  <h2>My Research</h2>
  <p>
  I study how carbon is cycled through the Earth system and the influences that humans have on these flows. I do this through two established research projects that focus on carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions from (1) small rivers and streams in the Appalachian region and (2) megacities around the world. My work has combined <strong>in-situ measurements</strong>, <strong>aircraft</strong>, and <strong>space-based remote sensing platforms</strong> to understand where natural and human-caused CO₂ emissions come from, how fluxes change over time, and how these changes affect Earth’s climate system. These efforts require me to blend advanced mathematics, atmospheric modeling, satellite retrievals, and data collected in the field to provide accurate and actionable information that drives carbon cycle science and informs communities.

  <h2>Watching Earth's Carbon Cycle from Space</h2>
  <p>
    Much of the CO₂ emitted by human activities originates from urban areas (cities). Monitoring these emissions from cities around the world is difficult because the necessary sensors are costly and take time to maintain. Fortunately, there are several space-based observation platforms that provide accurate estimates of CO₂ in Earth's atmosphere. The main focus of my work takes these space-based observations of atmospheric CO₂ and flows them backwards in time to their urban origins. These techniques allow me to study sector-specific emissions such as urban traffic and energy production. This work informs the emerging field of <strong>urban carbon monitoring</strong>, demonstrating how satellites can provide near-real-time insights that support local climate action. I now serve as the <strong>Science Principal Investigator (Science PI)</strong> on <strong>CMS-Urban</strong>, a NASA-funded project that expands this approach to multiple cities worldwide and incorporates additional atmospheric pollutants (CH₄, NO₂). This project builds toward operational observing systems capable of providing routine, high-resolution emissions estimates to scientists, policymakers, and the public.

  <h2>CO₂ Emissions from Appalachian Headwaters</h2>
  <p>
    Small headwater streams and creeks release CO₂ and CH₄ as carbon moves from the land to the water. Interestingly, these small rivers, streams, and creeks are significant sources of emissions, releasing these greenhouse gases during the transport process. These riverine networks are widespread in the Appalachian Mountains but are too small to be monitored with space-based technologies. Additionally, the complex terrain of Appalachia makes in-situ observations difficult as well. Nonetheless, these riverine emissions represent one of the most uncertain components of the modern carbon budget. To address this uncertainty, I recently launched the <strong>Small Tributaries Releasing Emissions in the Appalachian Mountains (STREAM)</strong> project which brings together scientists, teachers, and students to collect in-situ greenhouse gas measurements from rivers and streams. These ground-based observations are combined will be combined with NASA satellite data and data assimilation methods to better understand regional carbon emissions. STREAM not only fills a major scientific need, it also creates opportunities for students in rural communities to participate directly in climate science, building a bridge between local engagement and cutting-edge research.
