<b>Biography</b><br /></span>
I grew up in northwestern North Carolina where I attended Appalachian State Univeristy (Go 'Neers!). It was there that I double majored in Physics and Mathematics. During my time as an undergraduate, I served as a research assistant in ASU's Ion Trap Laboratory under the direction of Dr. Tony Calamai. After graduating, I spent a year teaching Mathematics at Ashe County High School (I received my own high school diploma from here long ago!) and a semester teaching Physics at Wilkes Community College. I then returned to ASU to complete my M.S. in Engineering Physics and M.A. in Mathematics. I worked as a graduate research assistant under the direction of Dr. Eric Marland. Much of my work was focused on sensitivity analyses using atmospheric modeling. I am now a Ph.D. student in the Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Utah, working with Dr. John Lin. In my free time, I am hiking, playing various musical instruments (piano, violin, guitar, bass), or occasionally working as a river guide/outfitter on the New River back in North Carolina.
